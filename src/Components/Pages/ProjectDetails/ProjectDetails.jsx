                        The Coastal Harmony Home project began with an in-depth consultation to understand the clientâ€™s vision of a modern coastal retreat. The design concept emphasized natural materials, a soothing color palette, and expansive views of the ocean. Key features included:

                        Open Living Spaces: Creating open-plan living areas to enhance the flow and connection between indoor and outdoor spaces.

                        Natural Materials: Using reclaimed wood, stone, and natural fibers to evoke a sense of harmony with the surrounding environment.

                        Large Windows: Installing floor-to-ceiling windows to maximize natural light and provide unobstructed ocean views.

                        Outdoor Living: Designing extensive outdoor areas, including a deck, pool, and garden, for relaxation and entertaining.

                        Modern Amenities: Incorporating state-of-the-art kitchen appliances, smart home technology, and luxurious bathroom fixtures.
